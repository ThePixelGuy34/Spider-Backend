# SPIDER BACKEND

Welcome to the **Spider Backend**! This project is open-source and a work in progress. Feel free to explore, contribute, and help improve it.

## ðŸš€ About This Project

This is my first fully custom backend, and while it is not yet complete, I am actively working on improvements. The main purpose of releasing this backend is to allow others to use it, provide feedback, and contribute to its development.

# Supported Seasons

## ðŸ“Œ Roadmap

### Upcoming Features & Fixes:

- Tournaments

## âœ… Current Features

âš  **Note:** The backend is still in early development, so functionality is limited.

- **Lobby Access** - lobby is broken needs to be fixed
- **Authentication** *(broken)* - needs to be fixed
- **MongoDB** - Requires nothing more unless you want to mod it and make it better
